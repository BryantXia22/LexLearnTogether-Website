Hackathon Project

What is the problem we are trying to solve?

A lot of students are looking for alternative ways to learn. With school officially cancelled, traditional methods of learning - working 
through a packet, reading textbook chapters, and so on - do not sufficiently engage students. We are trying to have teachers upload 
learning projects, outside of the curriculum but worthy of exploration, that will enable students to learn through explorations. 


In a nutshell, what is our idea?

We'll write a web platform with HTML and javascript, with tabs that lead to different subjects. Teachers can submit their learning 
projects by filling out a google form (with a catchy project title, prerequisites, detailed instructions, etc.), and we will upload them 
as soon as possible under the relevant section. Students will be able share their learning experience by submitting comments under the 
projects they have completed. In doing so, we'll be able to offer students high quality educational projects and opportunities to explore 
beyond their normal curriculum.
